# Fundraising-Analysis-Excel
Analysis of Kickstarter Fundraiser using Excel

The purpose is to describe the information presented from the datasheet and analyze the relationships between the variables of every Kickstarter project. The variables are the time created, deadline, country, category, money pledged, and more.


(Outcomes vs date launched)
The first analysis was to count the amount of successful, failed, and canceled theater projects and sort by the month it was launched. Project outcomes on the X-axis and the number of projects on the Y-axis. The first challenge was to identify and use a pivot table to derive the data into a line graph.


(difficulties)
The difficult part was finding the fields list to use the pivot table because the options to use the variables weren't there. It turns out my version of Excel has it defaulted to require a right-click and select show fields list. This discovery was a lucky find without the use of Youtube or a teaching assistant. I suspect solutions like that will be uncommon moving forward.

(results)
From the graph comparing the outcome of theater projects to the month of each year they launched, we can see a spike in successful Kickstarter that began in May. 110 successful campaigns to the 50 that failed. This may indicate a correlation between students' summer vacation and theater project outcomes because the highest points on the line graph are during summer. On an interesting note, the line graph for canceled projects cuts in October means there were no canceled projects during that month for every year. The line graph is an excellent representation because when time is a factor it is best shown as a traditional mathematical graph. Additionally, a column bar graph works just as well but is slightly messier in my opinion.


(Outcomes vs Goals)
The second analysis was to create a table comparing the percentage of total successful, failed, and canceled plays with the goal amount incrementing by 5000. To be specific, the plays' goals on the X-axis and the percentage of the successful outcomes are divided by the total outcomes on the Y-axis.


(difficulties)
What gave me trouble was understanding how to create the table without the use of a pivot table. I began to overthink the problem instead of using the given formulas to hardcode the values into the table. This made me spent more time than I should have to have because I need to do things the right way.


(results)
We can conclude that a majority of plays that had high goals above 15,000 failed more often except for the ones between 35,000 to 40,000. Additionally, there were no canceled plays. An alternative presentation that works just as well is the column bars.
